Current Plan

Get genomic regions around genes of interest and compare them with other organisms.

1. How to get genes of interest from NCBI?
    TODO check API reference.
    should I use the datasets tool? could be low effort.

2. How to get the area around of those genes?
    should i locally align those genes with BLAST or Smith Waterman?
    i tend to use smith waterman over BLAST+ as it is more straight forward to use.
    Should I then use an arbitrary number of BP before or after or the whole genome?
    Maybe use a number of genes around them?
    In NCBI i can download a region as Fasta or just the area around them.

3. How I get other genes in those areas?
    are those annotated in gff3? if yes would be perfect. Just need to parse them.
    also how do I organise them? should i build a class with biopython components for that?


3. How to visualize?
    If i compare the genomic region around them by locally aligning these genes to other organism.
    How do I properly visualize this programmatically without doing it by hand?
    Does a tool like this exist?
