Current Plan

Get genomic regions around genes of interest and compare them with other organisms.

1. How to get genes of interest from NCBI?
    TODO check API reference.
    should I use the datasets tool? could be low effort.

2. How to get the area around of those genes?
    should i locally align those genes with BLAST or Smith Waterman?
    i tend to use smith waterman over BLAST+ as it is more straight forward to use.
    Should I then use an arbitrary number of BP before or after or the whole genome?
    Maybe use a number of genes around them?
    In NCBI i can download a region as Fasta or just the area around them.

3. How I get other genes in those areas?
    are those annotated in gff3? if yes would be perfect. Just need to parse them.
    also how do I organise them? should i build a class with biopython components for that?


3. How to visualize?
    If i compare the genomic region around them by locally aligning these genes to other organism.
    How do I properly visualize this programmatically without doing it by hand?
    Does a tool like this exist?


Dependencies:
    if you are using linux you can run dependencies.sh

    it creates empty directories:
        ./fasta
        ./genomes
        ./genes
        ./ncbi_tools
        ./blast_db
        ./proteins
        ./proteins_filtered
        ./proteins_aligned

    otherwise some dependencies need to be installed specifically for your operating system accordingly like:

    ncbi binaries to ./ncbi_tools
        https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/datasets/command-line/LATEST/
        https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/datasets/command-line/LATEST/

    aliview tar extracted to ./aliview
        https://www.ormbunkar.se/aliview/downloads/

    mafft
        use your system package manager or download the installer online
